# Kubernetes Networking & Services

## Task

I practiced Kubernetes service networking using ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer, ExternalName, and Headless Service.

## Files

```text
manifests/01-clusterip/
manifests/02-nodeport/
manifests/03-loadbalancer/
manifests/04-externalname/
manifests/05-headless/
```

## Commands I ran

Run these commands from this assignment folder:

```bash
kubectl apply -f manifests/01-clusterip
kubectl rollout status deployment/web-app-clusterip --timeout=120s
kubectl wait --for=condition=Ready pod/curl-client --timeout=120s
kubectl get pods -l app=web-clusterip -o wide
kubectl get svc web-service-clusterip
kubectl get endpoints web-service-clusterip
kubectl exec curl-client -- curl -s http://web-service-clusterip:8080

kubectl apply -f manifests/02-nodeport
kubectl apply -f manifests/03-loadbalancer
kubectl apply -f manifests/04-externalname
kubectl apply -f manifests/05-headless
kubectl get svc
kubectl exec dns-test-client -- nslookup external-database-service
kubectl exec headless-dns-client -- nslookup web-service-headless
kubectl port-forward service/web-service-clusterip 18081:8080 --address 127.0.0.1
```

## Output

external-database-service.default.svc.cluster.local canonical name = nencyravaliya.me

Name: web-service-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.0.24
Name: web-service-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.0.23
Name: web-service-headless.default.svc.cluster.local
Address: 10.244.0.25
```

`LoadBalancer` showed `<pending>` because I tested this on a local `kind` cluster.

## What I understood

Services give pods stable networking. ClusterIP is internal, NodePort exposes a node port, LoadBalancer is used in cloud setups, ExternalName maps to DNS, and Headless Service returns pod IPs.

## Kubernetes object comparisons

| Object | Responsibility and use case | Scaling, identity and storage |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Manages ReplicaSets and rolling updates for stateless applications. | Desired replica count; interchangeable Pods, typically using Services and external/shared storage. |
| ReplicaSet | Maintains the requested number of matching Pods. | Replica count only; a Deployment normally manages it and orchestrates version rollouts. |
| DaemonSet | Runs an agent on each eligible node, such as a log collector. | Scales with eligible nodes, rather than a fixed replica count; often uses node-local storage. |
| StatefulSet | Manages workloads needing stable identity and persistent storage. | Ordered Pod names; headless Service identity; individual PVCs from volumeClaimTemplates. |
| Service | Provides discovery and stable networking to selected ready Pods. | Does not create, restart or scale Pods. A ReplicaSet keeps Pods alive; a Service routes traffic to them. |

Deployment and ReplicaSet are related through ownership: Deployment -> ReplicaSet -> Pod. Service selectors connect Service traffic to Pod labels independently of that ownership.

See [FQDN](fqdn/README.md) and [CoreDNS](coredns/README.md) for the remaining research tasks.
